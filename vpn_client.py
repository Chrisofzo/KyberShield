Quantum-Resistant VPN Client

This client performs:
1. Connect to VPN server at localhost:5555 using sockets
2. Generate client key pairs (X25519 + Kyber)
3. Receive server's public keys
4. Send client's public keys and Kyber ciphertext to server
5. Derive the same 256-bit session key using HKDF-SHA3-256
6. Initialize ChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD cipher
7. Encrypt multiple packets with fresh nonces
8. Receive and decrypt acknowledgment packets
